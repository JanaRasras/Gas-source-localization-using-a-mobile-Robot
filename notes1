all files should be in workspace , because 'catkin' will make -->build + compile
(sudo gedit ~/.bash) this makes sourcing for setup file
gedit is a text editor-->install it by this command -->sudo apt-get install gedit

sudo: gives admin rights to a command
apt-get: is a program for installing other software
intall: is an argument given to the "apt-get" program which indicates we want to install a software

bashrc is a hidden file (thats why it starts with a dot .bashrc)
this file is a bash script,,, it gets executed every time you open a terminal

bash scripting language is the language you use when you write in the terminal..


sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-kobuki ros-kinetic-kobuki-core
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-kobuki-gazebo

ROS packages can be:
1- source files: like the one I just sent
2-binary files, which you install directly using apt-get

cd catkin_ws
catkin_make --> this compiles for all pkgs in workspace
